- 👋 Hello! My name is @StiveBuch and I'm passionate about programming with a particular focus on Qt C++, PyQt, and Python.

- 🌱 Currently, I'm working hard to improve my skills in C++ and Python, and I'm always looking to learn new things and take on new challenges.

- 💞️ I'm open to collaborating on projects related to my interests, and I'm eager to connect with like-minded developers who share my passion for coding.

- 📫 If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me via GitHub or through my email [insert your email address here]. I'd love to hear from you!
